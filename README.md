## 🏗️ Architecture

MesBaoX is built upon **Layered Architecture** principles and **Clean Architecture** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. The project is structured into distinct layers:

*   **Domain:** :classical_building: Contains core business entities (e.g., Product, Order, Customer), value objects (e.g., Address), domain services (e.g., OrderCalculationService), and domain events (e.g., OrderCreatedEvent). It's independent of any specific frameworks or technologies.
*   **Application:** :gear: Contains use cases, implementing the **CQRS** pattern to separate read (Queries) and write (Commands) operations.
*   **Infrastructure:** :hammer_and_wrench: Contains specific implementations for database, caching, logging, external services, etc.
*   **Presentation:** :globe_with_meridians: Contains the Web API controllers (backend) and Angular components (frontend), responsible for interacting with the user and the Application layer.

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** :left_right_arrow: CQRS is used to segregate responsibilities between read and write operations, optimizing the performance and scalability of the system.
